# Netflix Remix ðŸŽ¬

Welcome to **Netflix Remix** â€” my first static website project, and a remix of the classic Netflix landing page.

Built using pure HTML and CSS, this clone was created by following the amazing **Sigma Webdev** tutorial â€” but with my own energy, curiosity, and the help of AI (shoutout to ChatGPT!). I didnâ€™t just follow along â€” I learned, explored, and understood each step to build this with clarity and intention.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- FontAwesome  
- Google Fonts  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features I'm Planning to Add
  
- A **mini sign-up form** logic (just frontend for now)  
- **Theme customizer** for light mode  
- A totally new section showcasing **free indie short films & solo productions** available on YouTube (via embeds or redirects)  

> This last one is a concept Iâ€™m super excited about â€” kind of like a spotlight for underrated creatorsðŸ”¥.
